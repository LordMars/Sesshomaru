This is the python script for the seshhomaru discord bot
Its only current purpose is to create a minecraft event scheduled at 5:30PM pst each monday.

The script itself does not schedule when it is run.
Done in the Sesshomaru seervice on a raspberry pi

In order for the script to run correctly a few things are required.
- a botConfig.json file in the resources directory
    This contains
    - token - the token of your discord bot
    - guildId - the id for the server the server the bot is in
    - eventList - a list of data for events to attempt to create
        Each of these events needs the following
        - name
        - description
        - startTime - the time to schedule this event for
            - hour(24 hour time)
            - minute
- a python installation with the discord, json, and pytz modules installed

Currently the bot always schedules events on Monday and in the Eastern timezone
